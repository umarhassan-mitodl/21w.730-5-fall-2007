Margaret Atwood's _Oryx and Crake_
{{< tdclose >}}

Students number off by threes and write on one of the following questions about _Oryx and Crake_:

> 1\. In what ways did Crake design the Crakers to be an improvement over _Homo sapiens_?
> 
> 2\. What ethical boundaries had been crossed before the apocalyptic epidemic to bring the world to the place we see in _Oryx and Crake_?
> 
> 3\. Jimmy is twice told "Don't let me down" and "I'm counting on you" in the novel. By whom? That imperative comes back on the last page. Which of the two people should he obey there at the end? Why?
